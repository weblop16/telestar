# Telegram Mini App With Stars Payments

A complete full-stack example of a modern Telegram Mini App for selling digital products using Telegram Stars payments. Built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Telegram Bot API, this app includes secure invoice generation, purchase history, secret content access after purchase, and refund processing via a Python companion bot. Ideal for Web3 developers, Telegram bot creators, and digital entrepreneurs looking to monetize through Telegram's payment ecosystem.

> **Note:** This application is designed to work exclusively within the Telegram ecosystem as a Telegram Mini App. It should be accessed only through Telegram and not directly via a web browser.

## Deployment
As this is a Telegram Mini App, it must be deployed and accessed through Telegram. Follow these steps:

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Sign up for a Vercel account if you haven't already
3. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel and deploy the app
4. During deployment, add your `BOT_TOKEN` as an environment variable in the Vercel dashboard
5. Once deployed, Vercel will provide you with a URL for your app
6. Use this URL to set up your Telegram Mini App:
   - Go to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram
   - Send the command `/newapp` or choose to edit an existing bot
   - Follow the prompts to set up your Mini App, using the Vercel URL as the Web App URL
7. Once set up, you can access your Mini App through Telegram on mobile devices or in the Web version of Telegram
